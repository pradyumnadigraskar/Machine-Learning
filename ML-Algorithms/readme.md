## 1. Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) focused on developing systems capable of learning from and making decisions based on data. The three primary categories of ML are:

- **Supervised Learning:** Learning with labeled data.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Identifying patterns in unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Learning by interacting with an environment to maximize rewards.

## 2. Supervised Learning

### Description
Supervised Learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the relationship between inputs (features) and outputs (labels) is established. The model learns to predict labels for new, unseen inputs.

### Types

1. **Regression:** Predicts continuous numerical values.
2. **Classification:** Predicts discrete categorical labels.

### Necessary Libraries

- **Python:** `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **R:** `caret`, `glmnet`

### Algorithms

#### 1. Linear Regression

- **Description:** Predicts a continuous target variable by establishing a linear relationship between independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target).
- **Formula:** \( y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \ldots + \beta_nx_n \)
- **Working:** Finds coefficients (\( \beta \)) that minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE):
  \[ MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 \]
- **Applications:** Predicting housing prices, stock prices.

#### 2. Logistic Regression

- **Description:** Used for binary classification tasks by mapping inputs to probabilities using a sigmoid function.
- **Formula:** \( P(y=1|x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}} \), where \( z = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \ldots \beta_nx_n \)
- **Working:** Estimates the likelihood of an event by applying maximum likelihood estimation.
- **Applications:** Spam detection, disease prediction.

#### 3. Polynomial Regression

- **Description:** Extends Linear Regression by fitting a polynomial curve to data for capturing non-linear relationships.
- **Formula:** \( y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \beta_2x^2 + \ldots + \beta_nx^n \)
- **Applications:** Growth prediction, trend analysis.

#### 4. Linear Classification

- **Description:** Separates data into different classes using a hyperplane.
- **Formula:** \( w \cdot x + b = 0 \)
- **Applications:** Document classification, email filtering.

#### 5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)

- **Description:** Finds the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes.
- **Formula:** Maximizes \( \frac{2}{||w||} \) subject to classification constraints.
- **Applications:** Image recognition, face detection.

#### 6. Decision Tree

- **Description:** Uses a tree-like structure for decision-making, splitting data based on feature thresholds.
- **Applications:** Loan approval, customer segmentation.

#### 7. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- **Description:** Classifies a sample based on the majority label among its \( k \)-nearest neighbors.
- **Applications:** Recommendation systems, pattern recognition.

#### 8. Random Forest

- **Description:** Combines multiple decision trees for better accuracy and reduced overfitting.
- **Applications:** Fraud detection, stock market analysis.

#### 9. Naive Bayes Classifier

- **Description:** Based on Bayes' Theorem, assumes independence between features.
- **Formula:** \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \)
- **Applications:** Sentiment analysis, spam filtering.

## 3. Unsupervised Learning

### Description
Unsupervised Learning deals with unlabeled data, focusing on discovering patterns, clusters, or reducing dimensionality.

### Types

1. **Clustering:** Groups similar data points.
2. **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reduces the number of features while preserving variance.

### Necessary Libraries

- **Python:** `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`
- **R:** `cluster`, `factoextra`

### Algorithms

#### 1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

- **Description:** Reduces the dimensionality of data by transforming it into principal components.
- **Applications:** Data compression, visualization.

#### 2. K-Means Clustering

- **Description:** Partitions data into \( k \) clusters by minimizing within-cluster variance.
- **Formula:** Minimizes \( \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{x \in C_i} ||x - \mu_i||^2 \)
- **Applications:** Market segmentation, document clustering.

#### 3. Hierarchical Clustering

- **Description:** Builds a hierarchy of clusters using agglomerative or divisive methods.
- **Applications:** Gene expression analysis, taxonomy.

#### 4. DBSCAN

- **Description:** Groups points close to each other based on density, identifying noise points.
- **Applications:** Anomaly detection, spatial data analysis.

#### 5. Autoencoders

- **Description:** Neural networks designed to encode data into a lower dimension and reconstruct it.
- **Applications:** Image compression, denoising.

## 4. Reinforcement Learning

### Description
Reinforcement Learning (RL) trains agents to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.

### Types

1. **Model-Free RL:** Direct interaction with the environment.
2. **Model-Based RL:** Builds a model of the environment for planning.

### Necessary Libraries

- **Python:** `gym`, `tensorflow`, `pytorch`
- **Frameworks:** `stable-baselines3`

### Algorithms

#### 1. Q-Learning

- **Description:** Uses a Q-value table to determine the best action.
- **Formula:** \( Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha [r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)] \)
- **Applications:** Game AI, navigation.

#### 2. Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

- **Description:** Combines Q-Learning with deep neural networks.
- **Applications:** Robotics, self-driving cars.

#### 3. Policy Gradient Methods

- **Description:** Directly optimizes the policy function for decision-making.
- **Applications:** Resource allocation, robotics.

#### 4. Actor-Critic Methods

- **Description:** Combines value-based and policy-based approaches for efficient learning.
- **Applications:** Multi-agent systems, continuous control tasks.
