# README: Understanding Ordinal Encoding and Code Explanation

## Introduction to Ordinal Encoding

Ordinal encoding is a technique used to convert categorical variables into numerical form while preserving their inherent order or ranking. It is particularly useful for categorical variables where the order matters, such as education levels (e.g., School < UG < PG) or quality ratings (e.g., Poor < Average < Good).

Ordinal encoding assigns integers to categories based on their order. For instance:
- Poor = 0
- Average = 1
- Good = 2

This ensures the numerical representation reflects the natural order of the categories.

## Explanation of the Code

### Importing Libraries
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```
- **numpy**: Used for numerical computations.
- **pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.

### Loading and Preprocessing the Dataset
```python
df = pd.read_csv('customer.csv')
df.sample(5)
df = df.iloc[:,2:]
```
- **`pd.read_csv('customer.csv')`**: Loads the dataset named `customer.csv` into a DataFrame.
- **`df.sample(5)`**: Displays 5 random samples from the DataFrame to inspect the data.
- **`df.iloc[:,2:]`**: Selects all rows and columns starting from the third column, effectively dropping the first two columns.

### Applying Ordinal Encoding
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder

oe = OrdinalEncoder(categories=[['Poor','Average','Good'],['School','UG','PG']])
oe.fit(X_train)
X_train = oe.transform(X_train)
```
1. **`from sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder`**: Imports the `OrdinalEncoder` class from scikit-learn.
2. **`OrdinalEncoder(categories=[['Poor','Average','Good'],['School','UG','PG']])`**:
   - Specifies the order of categories for ordinal encoding.
   - The first list maps the quality levels (`Poor`, `Average`, `Good`), and the second list maps the education levels (`School`, `UG`, `PG`).
3. **`oe.fit(X_train)`**:
   - Fits the encoder to the training data `X_train`. This step learns the mapping of categories to integers.
4. **`X_train = oe.transform(X_train)`**:
   - Transforms the categorical features in `X_train` to their ordinal numerical representation.

### Applying Label Encoding
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

le = LabelEncoder()
le.fit(y_train)
y_train = le.transform(y_train)
y_test = le.transform(y_test)
```
1. **`from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder`**: Imports the `LabelEncoder` class from scikit-learn.
2. **`le.fit(y_train)`**:
   - Fits the encoder to the target variable `y_train`.
   - Assigns a unique integer to each class label.
3. **`y_train = le.transform(y_train)`**:
   - Transforms the training target variable `y_train` into numerical form.
4. **`y_test = le.transform(y_test)`**:
   - Transforms the test target variable `y_test` into numerical form using the same mapping learned from `y_train`.

## Benefits of Ordinal Encoding
1. Preserves the order of categories, which is essential for ordinal data.
2. Converts categorical features into numerical values suitable for machine learning models.

## Summary
This code demonstrates how to preprocess categorical data using ordinal encoding for features with an inherent order and label encoding for target variables. These transformations ensure the data is ready for machine learning models while retaining the necessary semantics of the categories.
