# README: Handling Date and Time Data

This README explains how to work with date and time data in Python using pandas and numpy. It includes detailed explanations of each line of code and the associated parameters.

## Overview
Date and time handling is a critical part of data analysis and processing. The ability to extract, manipulate, and analyze date and time information allows for detailed insights into temporal patterns and trends.

### Code Breakdown

#### Importing Required Libraries
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```
- **numpy**: Provides support for mathematical operations and handling numerical data.
- **pandas**: Offers powerful data manipulation tools, including support for date and time data.

#### Reading the Data
```python
date = pd.read_csv('orders.csv')
time = pd.read_csv('messages.csv')
```
- `pd.read_csv()`: Reads CSV files into DataFrame objects.
  - `'orders.csv'` and `'messages.csv'`: File names containing the data.

#### Converting to Datetime
```python
date['date'] = pd.to_datetime(date['date'])
```
- `pd.to_datetime()`: Converts strings or numeric representations of dates into pandas datetime objects.
  - `date['date']`: Column in the `date` DataFrame to be converted.

#### Extracting Year
```python
date['date_year'] = date['date'].dt.year
```
- `dt.year`: Extracts the year from datetime objects.

#### Sampling Data
```python
date.sample(5)
```
- `sample(5)`: Displays 5 random rows from the DataFrame.

#### Extracting Month
```python
date['date_month_no'] = date['date'].dt.month
```
- `dt.month`: Extracts the month number from datetime objects.

#### Extracting Month Name
```python
date['date_month_name'] = date['date'].dt.month_name()
```
- `dt.month_name()`: Extracts the full name of the month.

#### Extracting Day
```python
date['date_day'] = date['date'].dt.day
```
- `dt.day`: Extracts the day of the month.

#### Extracting Day of the Week
```python
date['date_dow'] = date['date'].dt.dayofweek
```
- `dt.dayofweek`: Returns the day of the week as an integer (0=Monday, 6=Sunday).

#### Extracting Day Name
```python
date['date_dow_name'] = date['date'].dt.day_name()
```
- `dt.day_name()`: Returns the name of the day of the week.

#### Identifying Weekends
```python
date['date_is_weekend'] = np.where(date['date_dow_name'].isin(['Sunday', 'Saturday']), 1, 0)
```
- `np.where()`: Assigns 1 if the day is Saturday or Sunday, else 0.
  - `date['date_dow_name'].isin(['Sunday', 'Saturday'])`: Checks if the day name is a weekend.

#### Extracting Week Number
```python
date['date_week'] = date['date'].dt.week
```
- `dt.week`: Returns the week number of the year.

#### Extracting Quarter
```python
date['quarter'] = date['date'].dt.quarter
```
- `dt.quarter`: Extracts the quarter of the year (1-4).

#### Assigning Semester
```python
date['semester'] = np.where(date['quarter'].isin([1, 2]), 1, 2)
```
- `np.where()`: Assigns 1 for the first semester (quarters 1 and 2) and 2 for the second semester.

#### Calculating Difference from Today
```python
import datetime
today = datetime.datetime.today()
```
- `datetime.datetime.today()`: Gets the current date and time.

```python
today - date['date']
```
- Calculates the difference between today and the dates in the DataFrame.

#### Days Passed
```python
(today - date['date']).dt.days
```
- `.dt.days`: Converts the timedelta object into the number of days.

#### Months Passed
```python
np.round((today - date['date']) / np.timedelta64(1, 'M'), 0)
```
- `np.timedelta64(1, 'M')`: Converts the difference into months.
- `np.round()`: Rounds the result to the nearest whole number.

#### Extracting Time Components
```python
time['date'] = pd.to_datetime(time['date'])
time['hour'] = time['date'].dt.hour
time['min'] = time['date'].dt.minute
time['sec'] = time['date'].dt.second
```
- `dt.hour`, `dt.minute`, `dt.second`: Extract the hour, minute, and second components, respectively.

#### Extracting Time
```python
time['time'] = time['date'].dt.time
```
- `dt.time`: Extracts the time component.

#### Time Difference in Various Units
```python
(today - time['date']) / np.timedelta64(1, 's')
```
- Converts the time difference into seconds (`'s'`), minutes (`'m'`), or hours (`'h'`).

## Conclusion
This code demonstrates how to handle, manipulate, and analyze date and time data in pandas. By converting data into datetime objects and leveraging pandas' `.dt` accessor, we can extract detailed temporal insights efficiently.
